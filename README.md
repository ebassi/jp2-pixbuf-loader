# JPEG2000 Pixbuf Loader

This is a [GdkPixbuf](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdk-pixbuf) loader module for JPEG2000. It uses [OpenJPEG](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg) to load JPEG2000 images as linear buffers in memory.

Note: by default there already some JPEG2000 support in GdkPixbuf, but that uses the [JasPer](https://github.com/mdadams/jasper) image library, which only supports certain parts of the massive JPEG2000 standard, meaning certain images don't work.
